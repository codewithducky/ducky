# Ducky

Programming is hard, and learning it is harder -- I want to make it easier.

The idea of creating an intelligent tutoring system which can assist novice
programmers in their journey learning to code is not original, there's plenty
of literature describing attempts to make such a thing. Ducky is my own attempt
to create such a piece of software, except it's not quite there yet. We're
currently in [phase A](#phase-a) of this project.

What makes Ducky different?

1. Ducky is based on empirical evidence. I'm not going to say this works or
   doesn't work until I actually know what effects it has on the learning
   outcomes of students who use it.
2. It has a very narrow applicable domain. Ducky helps students learn p5.js and
   JavaScript. No more, no less.

The core beliefs of Ducky:

1. In order to learn you have to struggle. Ducky should never hand you the
   answer to a problem.
2. Humans are better at doing some things than robots, and humans should do
   those things when possible.
3. Privacy and FOSS are important. Attempts should be made to anonymise any
   code of students which end up, on our servers.

## Phase A

In order to figure out whether this system is going to be useful to students we
need to collect some data, this iteration of Ducky is responsible for doing that.

1. Collect data about different kinds of errors
2. Start coming up with strategies to virtually resolve these errors

## Phase B

This is the phase of Ducky where it will actually become useful in the way I wanted it to be: detecting errors in real time and providing feedback.
