<h1>Ducky: Participant Information Sheet</h1>

<h2>Researcher:</h2>
<p>My name is Harrison Shoebridge and I am a Bachelor of Advanced Computing student at the ANU.</p>

<h2>Project title:</h2>
<p>Impact on errors for students learning p5.js</p>

<h2>General Outline of the Project</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Description and Methodology:</strong> I am conducting research on how errors impact the experience of people learning p5.js and JavaScript. It’s commonly accepted that part of the difficulty of learning to program is in overcoming errors, but little is known (particularly in the context of JavaScript and p5.js) what sort of tangible impact these errors actually have on students like yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Participants:</strong> I’m intending to collect error reports from as many COMP1720 students as possible this semester. </li>
    <li><strong>Use of Data and Feedback:</strong> The data will be used for my honours project next year. We may publish both analysis of the dataset, as well as a version of the dataset containing error classifications without any source code. At the end of the course we will contact all participants and provide a summary of the data we analysed. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant Involvement</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal:</strong> Your participation in this research is voluntary and your participation will have no effect on assessable items in COMP1720. You may decline to take part in or withdraw from this research at any time until the work is prepared for publication. Within this research, opt to not answer any question you wish. If you withdraw, the data you have provided prior to withdrawal will be destroyed and not used.</li>
    <li><strong>What does participation in the research entail?</strong> If you choose to participate in this research you will be asked to submit information about the problems you’ve came across while completing COMP1720 assessments. After you consent you will be asked to answer a set demographic questions, so we know your background as a programmer. When you volunteer to submit an error we will take a record of your code and information so we can diagnose the error at a later date. This will be either a JavaScript error message or two short answer questions. You will be able to choose which of your errors you want to submit, though we encourage you to submit as many as you can. The only people with access to the raw dataset will be myself and Ben. </li>
    <li><strong>Location and Duration:</strong> This research will be conducted over the course of the entire semester whenever you are attempting to complete COMP1720 coursework. The amount of time you spend on this research will be directly proportional to how many errors you decide to submit, we don’t anticipate reporting an error will take longer than 30 seconds.</li>
    <li><strong>Risks:</strong> The main risk of participating in this research is third-party identification based on the information you send to us in your error reports. We will review each error report before it is published and attempt to remove any personally identifiable information which is submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will catch every instance of identifiable information, so it is best to avoid putting anything you do not wish to be published into an error report.</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> The collection of this data will allow us to learn more about how people learn p5.js and JavaScript. With this knowledge we’ll be able to help you learn better, and eventually design tools to improve the way people learn to code in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>The only people with access to the raw dataset will be the nominated researchers (Ben & Harrison). For the entire lifetime of this dataset your confidentiality will be protected as far as the law allows. As well as your original consent, we will store a link between your university identifier and your unique identifier in our system. This will be used so we can delete your data should you then decide to revoke your consent to our data collection to prevent it being published in any capacity. When your data is published or viewed by a reviewer you will be referred to by your unique identifier. Any published data will only include this unique identifier and excerpts from your error reports, which we will make a best-effort attempt to anonymise these. However, should you wish something not be published, you should not submit it in an error report.</p>

<h2>Privacy Notice</h2>

<p>In collecting your personal information within this research, the ANU must comply with the Privacy Act 1988. The ANU Privacy Policy is available at https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_010007 and it contains information about how a person can: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Access or seek correction to their personal information;</li>
    <li>Complain about a breach of an Australian Privacy Principle by ANU, and how ANU will handle the complaint.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Where:</strong> Your data will be stored on a password protected ANU server, with the only people having access to it being Ben & Harrison. </li>
    <li><strong>How long:</strong> Data will be stored for one year after the conclusion of my honours project. After this it will be deleted. If I graduate and do not continue studying at the ANU Ben will become the custodian of the data collected here and will delete it when required to.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling of Data following the required storage period: </strong> While we intend to delete the raw copy of this dataset since it will be impossible to de-identify, we intend to an publish an anonymised subset of it (without source code) which will be publicly available. The location of this will be communicated to participants after the conclusion of the study.</li>
</ul>
